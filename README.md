# Form Validation in React :collision:

A form validation built in ReactJS where the user's email address and password are checked. Here, the form checks email address for it's format i.e. whether the email address is in the intended format where it should be having "@", whereas the password is checked to make sure whether it's having 8 or more characters.

**Motivation:** While working on my side projects, I often came across such situations which involved implementing form validation where most of the times I was checking user's email address and their password. Thus, in order to avoid the hassle of rewriting the code again and again from the scratch, I decided to develop a component for that purpose. In order to make sure that this component can be easily used by other people, I have designed this component in such a manner so that it can be easily customised as per the desired requirements.

**Happy Coding** :octocat:**!**
