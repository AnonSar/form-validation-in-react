# Form Validation in React :squirrel:

A form validation built in ReactJS where the user's email address and password are checked. Here, the form checks email address for it's format i.e. whether the email address is in the intended format where it should be having "@", whereas the password is checked to make sure whether it's having 8 or more characters.

**Motivation:** During my time at the internship and my part time job, I was working on projects which often involved implementing form validation where most of the times I was checking user's email address and their password. Thus, in order to avoid the hassle of rewriting the code again and again from the scratch, I decided to develop a component for that purpose. I have designed this component in such a manner that it can be easily customised as per the user's requirements.

**Happy Coding** :octocat:**!**
